## Overview

This project created with the purpose to apply most of concepts implementeds by the state manager [GetX][getx_package]. Using a small flux of screens to simulate a shopping cart, this project implements a folder architeture that make sense for placing all the widgets tree from a screen to have secure access of its parent controllers.

In general, this project is part of a studies to understand the best architecture pattern to implement in flutter projects that works for me and i hope to works for you too.

## Resources

I made use of some approaches to make this project simple and objective to fulfill your proposal, one of these approaches is the use of internal data as a json file and images in `assets` folder to simulate an fetch api, so you can fork this project and have no worriy about outside resources.

- Page with list of produts;
- Switch between categories;
- List products for a selected category;
- Like in products _`(i tried to make this project uncomplicated, so the state of likes is lost when switch between categories)`_;
- Page of product to see more information;
- Add selected product to cart;
- Counter of products in cart;
- Page of products in cart;
- Increase/Decrese quantity for each product;
- Increse a max of 10 unities per product;
- Delete product from cart;
- A totalizer of products prices in cart; 
- Purchase (It clears the cart and returns to home);

## The project structure

For this project, i focused to solve the problem using only the GetX resources and following the below structure i feel good about the results,  the simplicity to understand the project and its rules.

```yaml
- /models
# This folder was used to place all the possible entities 
# who has the responsability to keep data making use of 
# Rx (An observer for variable in GetX). Even having other 
# options, i decided tu use Rx for every variable as a pattern. 

- /pages
# This is the folder who we have to get more attention and
# careful to manage the structure becaouse GetX can be used in 
# many different ways, and a wrong way maybe can broken you app 
# in the future, so because that, i defined some rules:
    - /page_name
        # RULE 1: For all pages, we have to create a folder
        # named with our page name where we can create the 
        # appropriate files.
        - index.dart
        # RULE 2: Every page must to have an index.dart as a 
        # unique point of access responsible for initialize this 
        # page; also, this file must start with a GetBuilder 
        # component, who will initialize our controller and 
        # provide it for all the widget childrens on the tree 
        # of page.
        - controller.dart
        # RULE 3: Every page, in most of cases, will need to
        # implement a controller to take care about some 
        # particular data and functions for this page. How this 
        # controller is initialized in a GetBuilder on index.
        # dart, it only will be available and alive while this 
        # page is in use, for any other case, this controller 
        # will not be available. 
        - /widgets        
        # RULE 4: How our controller only will be available 
        # while page is instanciated, any widget placed in this 
        # folder can make use of Get.find(PageNameController) 
        # and access its data and functions. Because that, all 
        # the widgets placed here must to have a direct 
        # relationship with the page and cannot be moved to 
        # other folders in any circunstances, if it happens, the 
        # code will not break for IDE or compilations, but 
        # probably you will have problems in runtime because it 
        # widget will try to use a controllar that could be 
        # unavailable.

- /utils
# Used for generic purposes the utils implements functions 
# to be used in the most parts of our project without 
# dependencies of other files.

- /widgets
# Called for many peoples of `shared` or `common`, i decided
# to call this folder of `widgets` because only shared widgets 
# is placed here, and also, this widgets cannot depend of other 
# files to keep working anywhere.

- controller.dart
# This file is a global controller who take care about some 
# global data and functions, can be used by any widget on the 
# project just making use of Get.find(AppController) in any 
# widget who needs to access this data or functions. It is 
# possible because this controller is initialized on main.dart 
# and teorycally, never should be disposed because main.dart 
# represents our instanced application.

- main.dart
# This file is the point of start of application, it means that 
# if it dispose, the app should closes too. This file has the
# responsability to initialize the GetX context, start our 
# AppController for global purposes and implement all 
# the route screens to allow navigations. Also, to initialize 
# the AppController in this file, i make use of 
# Get.put(AppController()) because the use of named_routes in 
# the GetMaterialApp does not instance any Widget direcly, 
# therefore, it cannot be used with GetBuild.

- routes.dart
# For this project, i decided to make use of named routed 
# because GetX implements some intersting things with it, and 
# the most interting resource is the possibility to pass 
# arguments over the route like is made with web projects. In 
# general this is very good for a clear understood of the pages 
# structure and any page who implements this arguments can 
# access it making use of Get.parameters["argument_name"]. Well 
# this file has the only responsability to map all the pages of 
# our application and return an Array for out main.dart.
